<h3>Description</h3>
This is the relational database management system (RDBMS) engine and parser for our team project for CSCE 315 - Programming studio.

There is also an application that could be used to track inventory between warehouses and stores. There are three entities <strong> Items, Stores, and Warehouses</strong> and two relations <strong> Items in Stores and Warehouses that stock Stores </strong>
